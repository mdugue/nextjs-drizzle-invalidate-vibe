Context (assume unless stated otherwise):
	‚Ä¢	Framework: Next.js App Router with React Server Components + Server Actions
	‚Ä¢	Data: Drizzle ORM (SQLite/Postgres) via Server Actions and/or Route Handlers (app/api/*) with fetch
	‚Ä¢	UI: shadcn/ui + Tailwind
	‚Ä¢	Forms/validation: React Hook Form + Zod (server is source of truth)
	‚Ä¢	Tooling: TypeScript strict, Biome + Ultracite, CI for typecheck/lint/build
	‚Ä¢	Concerns: pagination, overview/detail, optimistic updates, invalidations, stable page count after delete/update

Goal: Perform an expert review focused on correctness, architecture, performance, accessibility, data consistency, and DX. Provide concrete, code-level fixes.

‚∏ª

1) Architecture & RSC Boundaries
	‚Ä¢	Verify Server vs Client component split; remove unnecessary "use client".
	‚Ä¢	Server Actions: validate inputs with Zod (server-side); ensure idempotency, transactional integrity, and clear error mapping.
	‚Ä¢	Apply revalidatePath/revalidateTag/cache correctly; avoid data waterfalls.
	‚Ä¢	Identify hydration pitfalls (unstable props, Dates, random IDs, locale objects).

2) Routing & UX States
	‚Ä¢	App Router conventions: colocated layout.tsx, loading.tsx, error.tsx, not-found.tsx, metadata.ts.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure overview/detail flows: sheets vs pages use proper URL state (search params/segments), focus management, and back/forward navigation.
	‚Ä¢	Defensive handling of dynamic params and searchParams.

3) Data Layer (Drizzle + Server Actions / Route Handlers)
	‚Ä¢	Drizzle schema & migrations consistent; types correct; indexes present for filters/sorts/pagination.
	‚Ä¢	Use parameterized queries only; avoid string concatenation.
	‚Ä¢	Prevent N+1 with appropriate joins or prefetch queries.
	‚Ä¢	Use transactions for multi-step mutations; guarantee atomicity.
	‚Ä¢	Keep secrets/server-only env server-side (no leakage via next.config or serialized props).
	‚Ä¢	If using route handlers: correct HTTP semantics, status codes, cache headers; no over-fetching.

4) Pagination, Invalidation & Consistency
	‚Ä¢	Define and verify the pagination model (cursor/offset).
	‚Ä¢	After create/update/delete, ensure list + detail stay in sync using revalidateTag/revalidatePath and local state reconciliation so the current number of pages remains stable.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid stale UI after optimistic updates; implement rollback paths on failure.

5) Forms, Validation, and Mutations
	‚Ä¢	RHF + Zod: server is the authority; client derives types.
	‚Ä¢	Return structured errors from actions; map to field and form errors.
	‚Ä¢	Handle file uploads/large payloads with streaming where appropriate.

6) UI/Accessibility/Styling
	‚Ä¢	shadcn: consistent usage; tree-shakable imports; no unused components.
	‚Ä¢	Tailwind: avoid class construction that breaks purge; maintain spacing/typography scales.
	‚Ä¢	A11y: keyboard navigation, roles/labels, color contrast; dialogs/sheets trap & restore focus.

7) Performance & Bundles
	‚Ä¢	Prefer RSC for data-heavy work; keep client components lean.
	‚Ä¢	Use dynamic imports for heavy client-only widgets.
	‚Ä¢	Check Next/Image, prefetch behavior of Link, caching headers.
	‚Ä¢	Spot re-render hotspots; memoize only when it meaningfully reduces work.

8) Security & Access Control
	‚Ä¢	Server-side auth/authorization checks (ABAC/RBAC if present).
	‚Ä¢	Prevent IDOR and over-posting; validate identifiers and ownership.
	‚Ä¢	Sanitize user content; safe redirects; CSRF considerations for non-idempotent actions.

9) Testing & Tooling
	‚Ä¢	Recommend unit/integration/e2e coverage (Vitest/Playwright).
	‚Ä¢	Tests for pagination, optimistic mutations + rollback, error/load/not-found states.
	‚Ä¢	Biome/Ultracite config: ensure deprecated rules policy (warn vs error) aligns with CI; include typecheck and build in CI.

üìé Example Invocation

Review this Next.js App Router project (RSC, Server Actions, Drizzle, shadcn, RHF+Zod).
Pay special attention to pagination and keeping the current page count stable after deletes/updates.
Call out hydration risks and any misuse of revalidateTag/revalidatePath.

Start with:
	‚Ä¢	app/(routes)/items/page.tsx, app/(routes)/items/[id]/page.tsx, components/ItemSheet.tsx
	‚Ä¢	server/actions/items.ts, lib/revalidate.ts
	‚Ä¢	db/schema.ts, drizzle/*.sql
	‚Ä¢	components/ui/*

Then propose code diffs and a unified invalidation plan.
